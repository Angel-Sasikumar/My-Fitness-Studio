Ironically, the country that gave the world Yoga and Spirituality is embroiled today in sloth and reckless consumerism.

Driven by our love for fried food, sugar overloads and a host of other dietary disasters the situation only becomes more scary. We are sitting on a ticking time bomb.<br>

Studies reveal that India's disease burden is causing it to lose billions of dollars in treatment and loss of productivity.<br>
